# Wendy Entitlements Workflow

Use this for any task involving `wendy.json` capabilities. Base recommendations on the runtime behavior in `wendy-agent/go/internal/agent/oci/entitlements.go` and validation in `wendy-agent/go/internal/shared/appconfig/appconfig.go`.

## Platform scope

Entitlements apply to containerized platforms (`linux`/`wendyos` and `wendy-lite`). Darwin (native macOS) apps run non-containerized and do not use WendyOS container entitlements.

## Start from app needs

Ask what the app actually touches, then choose the smallest entitlement set:

- Server, WebRTC, callbacks, debugger, or LAN-visible API: `network`.
- NVIDIA/Jetson inference or CUDA: `gpu`.
- Present to a locally-attached monitor as a Wayland client: `display`.
- Microphone, speaker, ALSA, PipeWire, PulseAudio compatibility: `audio`.
- V4L2 cameras or USB webcams: `camera`.
- Model cache, database, user uploads, generated files, or persistent app state: `persist`.
- BlueZ Bluetooth access: `bluetooth`.
- Raw USB devices: `usb`.
- I2C bus devices: `i2c`.
- GPIO chips: `gpio`.
- SPI devices: `spi`.
- Serial ports (USB-serial adapters, servo buses): `serial`.
- HID/input event devices: `input`.
- MCP tool servers: `mcp`.
- Full local device control (app orchestration, reading all device data): `admin`.

Prefer no entitlement when the app does not need the host resource.

## Supported entitlements

Use this table as the starting point, then verify against the local repo when changing runtime behavior:

| Type | Required keys | Common optional keys | Runtime effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `network` | none | `mode` as `host` or `none` | Defaults to host networking when `mode` is empty; `host` removes the network namespace and mounts host DNS config. |
| `gpu` | none | none | Jetson: adds NVIDIA device nodes, env vars, CDI wiring. Raspberry Pi: exposes `/dev/vcio` for board telemetry. |
| `display` | none | none | Grants `/dev/dri` (GPU render nodes) and the WendyOS compositor's Wayland socket; allows the container to present to a locally-attached monitor as a Wayland client. Requires a display-enabled WendyOS image; on headless images the socket is absent so nothing renders. On Jetson, GPU graphics userspace is injected from the host via CDI. At most one per app. |
| `audio` | none | none | Adds audio group, mounts `/dev/snd`, allows sound devices, and mounts PipeWire/Pulse sockets when present. |
| `camera` | none | `mode`, `allowlist` | Canonical V4L2/camera entitlement; allows major 81, bind-mounts host `/dev` for live camera hotplug, and bind-mounts `/run/udev` read-only for libcamera CSI enumeration. |
| `video` | none | `mode`, `allowlist` | Deprecated compatibility alias for `camera`; prefer `camera` in new configs. |
| `persist` | `name`, `path` | none | Creates/binds `/var/lib/wendy/volumes/<name>` to the container `path`; volume names are shared across apps. |
| `bluetooth` | none | `mode` | Uses a filtered `xdg-dbus-proxy` socket for BlueZ. Do not assume unrestricted host D-Bus access. |
| `usb` | none | none | Mounts `/dev/bus/usb` and allows USB character devices. |
| `i2c` | `device` | none | Binds `/dev/<device>` such as `/dev/i2c-1` and allows I2C devices. |
| `gpio` | none | `pins` | Mounts existing `/dev/gpiochip0` through `/dev/gpiochip7`; `pins` are documentation/validation, access is chip-level. |
| `spi` | none | none | Mounts existing `/dev/spidev*` nodes and adds the host `spi` group when present. |
| `input` | none | none | Adds input group, mounts `/dev/input`, and allows input event devices. |
| `serial` | `device` | none | Binds `/dev/<device>` (e.g. `/dev/ttyACM0`) and adds the `dialout` group. USB-only; on-board UARTs (`ttyAMA*`, `ttyS*`) are not supported. |
| `mcp` | `port` | none | Exposes an MCP server port for agentic tool access. |
| `admin` | none | none | Grants the container the wendy-agent's local control socket (exposed as `WENDY_AGENT_SOCKET`, currently `/run/wendy/agent/agent.sock` — read the env var, don't hard-code). This is the agent's **full gRPC with no authentication** — an app with `admin` can start, stop, and delete apps and read all device data locally. **Grant it only to fully-trusted first-party apps.** At most one per app. Requires an agent build that serves the local socket. |

`network.ports` is accepted by config validation, but the runtime path in `entitlements.go` currently acts on `mode`. Do not claim port mapping behavior without tracing the caller that consumes `ports`.

## Example patterns

Web server:

```json
{
  "appId": "api-server",
  "platform": "linux",
  "entitlements": [
    { "type": "network", "mode": "host" }
  ],
  "readiness": {
    "tcpSocket": { "port": 8000 },
    "timeoutSeconds": 30
  }
}
```

Camera + audio app:

```json
{
  "appId": "camera-assistant",
  "platform": "linux",
  "entitlements": [
    { "type": "network", "mode": "host" },
    { "type": "camera" },
    { "type": "audio" }
  ]
}
```

Jetson GPU app with persistent model cache:

```json
{
  "appId": "vision-inference",
  "platform": "linux",
  "entitlements": [
    { "type": "network", "mode": "host" },
    { "type": "gpu" },
    { "type": "camera" },
    { "type": "persist", "name": "vision-models", "path": "/models" }
  ]
}
```

I2C sensor app:

```json
{
  "appId": "sensor-reader",
  "platform": "linux",
  "entitlements": [
    { "type": "i2c", "device": "i2c-1" },
    { "type": "persist", "name": "sensor-data", "path": "/data" }
  ]
}
```

Serial device app (USB-serial servo bus):

```json
{
  "appId": "servo-controller",
  "platform": "linux",
  "entitlements": [
    { "type": "network", "mode": "host" },
    { "type": "serial", "device": "ttyACM0" }
  ]
}
```

## Review checklist

- `appId` is present.
- Entitlement names are current; prefer `camera` over `video`.
- `persist` entries include both `name` and an absolute container `path`.
- `i2c` entries include a device name without a leading `/dev/`.
- `serial` entries include a bare USB tty node name (e.g. `ttyACM0`, `ttyUSB0`) matching `^(ttyACM|ttyUSB)[0-9]+$`; on-board UARTs (`ttyAMA*`, `ttyS*`) are not supported.
- Device-heavy apps include only the devices they actually use.
- GPU issues are checked across app image, device type, CDI, agent logs, and app fallback behavior before blaming the entitlement alone.
- JSON examples remain valid JSON; do not put comments inside `wendy.json`.
