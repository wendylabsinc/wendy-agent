"""Reference model app for the Wendy model harness.

Demonstrates the three harness contracts end to end:

  1. Sensors in    — camera frames FED BY THE HARNESS over the app-private
                     sensor socket granted by the sensor-read entitlement. The
                     app opens no device: it subscribes to the same
                     producer the episode capture adapter consumes, so the
                     two never fight over the camera, and every frame the
                     model sees is recorded into the active episode under
                     the identifier the app was given.
  2. Predictions out — one "prediction" record per processed frame, naming
                     the sample identifiers it was computed from, plus a
                     "person_detected" event, over the app-private data
                     socket granted by the episode-write entitlement.
  3. Actuation out — a Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) Twist command on
                     /cmd_vel when ROS 2 is available and enabled; the
                     same decision is logged when it is not.

The detector is YOLOv8n exported to Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)
at image build time and run with onnxruntime on the Central Processing
Unit (CPU) by default, so the app runs on any dev box. See README.md for
the Jetson Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) wheel path.
