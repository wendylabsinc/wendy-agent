# ComposeEnv

Demonstrates that `environment:` values in `docker-compose.yml` are now
forwarded to each container by Wendy (WDY-1268, PR #897).

```
ComposeEnv/
├── docker-compose.yml   ← defines environment: vars for the server
├── wendy.json           ← companion: appId + port entitlement
├── server/              ← HTTP server that returns its own env vars as JSON
└── client/              ← fetches the server response and validates the vars
```

## What changed (WDY-1268)

Before PR #897, Wendy silently ignored `environment:` entries in compose files
— the `TODO` in the CLI read:
> *"compose `environment:` values aren't sent to the device yet"*

Now `wendy compose` reads each service's `environment:` block and passes it
as the new `env` field on `CreateContainerRequest`. The agent applies them in
the order: **image built-in env → user compose env → Wendy system env**.
Wendy system vars (`WENDY_APP_ID`, `WENDY_HOSTNAME`, …) always win.

## Unsupported field warnings (WDY-1270)

If your compose file uses fields Wendy doesn't honour (`devices`, `privileged`,
`ipc`, `cap_add`, `cap_drop`, `sysctls`, `security_opt`, `cgroup`, `pid`), the
CLI now prints a warning per service rather than silently ignoring them:

```
warning: service "server" uses unsupported Compose fields (ignored by Wendy): privileged
```

The deploy still proceeds — the warning is informational.

## Run on a Wendy device

```sh
cd Examples/ComposeEnv
wendy run
```

Expected output:

```
[server] listening on :8080
[server] APP_MODE    = production
[server] GREETING    = Hello from Wendy!
[server] MAX_WORKERS = 4
[client] WENDY_HOSTNAME        = client.local
[client] WENDY_DEVICE_HOSTNAME = wendyos-<name>.local
[client] waiting for server at http://wendyos-<name>.local:8080 ...
[client] server response:
{
  "from_compose_environment": {
    "APP_MODE": "production",
    "GREETING": "Hello from Wendy!",
    "MAX_WORKERS": "4"
  },
  "from_wendy_agent": {
    "WENDY_APP_ID": "sh.wendy.examples.composeenv",
    "WENDY_HOSTNAME": "server.local",
    ...
  }
}
[client] ✓ all compose environment: vars reached the server container
```

## Run locally with Docker Desktop

`docker-compose.yml` is unmodified, so it works as-is with Docker Desktop
(environment vars are native Docker Compose behaviour):

```sh
docker compose up
```

The client falls back to `http://server:8080` when `WENDY_DEVICE_HOSTNAME` is
absent.
