# Host sensor loopback check

This test runs on the device host through authenticated `wendy device shell`.
It checks the installed files and vermagic for the running kernel, loads the
drivers, and verifies their character devices. It does not deploy a container.

The image contracts are:

- Dragonwing IQ8, IQ9 and Arduino Uno Q require `v4l2loopback` and `snd-aloop`.
- Jetson images require `v4l2loopback`.

Known boards without a loopback image contract and non-WendyOS platforms are
explicitly skipped. An unknown WendyOS board or missing OS identity fails.
Missing required modules, an incompatible video control ABI, failed module
loads and missing endpoints fail. No physical camera or microphone is needed.
The test leaves loaded modules available for the agent and does not unload them.

Run against a device:

```sh
go/scripts/test-ci.sh -h DEVICE -t host-sensor-loopback
```

Run local regressions without a device or module loads:

```sh
python3 .github/ci-tests/host-sensor-loopback/check_test.py
```

The test is registered in `go/scripts/test-ci.sh`'s `ALL_TESTS`. The hardware
integration workflow uses that registry directly, so default qualification runs
include this host check without a separate workflow test list. Candidate OS
qualification runs it after installing and verifying the exact image under test.
Updating the agent alone does not prove that a candidate image contains its
required kernel modules.

The Go tests workflow runs the local shell and harness regressions. Neither the
local regressions nor an explicit skip on an unsupported platform proves the
loopback contract on a supported physical board.
