// Package episodeexport turns an episode's camera capture into files that
// ordinary video players can play, without touching the episode itself.
//
// The problem it solves. Episode camera capture keeps an H.264 Annex-B
// elementary stream (cameras/<source>/segment-NNNNNN.h264). An elementary
// stream is a bare sequence of coded pictures: it has no container, and
// therefore carries no timing whatsoever. A player handed one has nothing to
// derive a presentation schedule from, so it invents a frame rate, and the clip
// runs at the wrong speed and reports the wrong duration.
//
// Why a fixed frame rate is not the fix. Passing a constant rate, whether
// guessed or measured as an average, replaces one wrong schedule with another.
// The capture rate is genuinely variable: it falls as the device gets busy with
// inference, so no single number describes more than a fraction of the clip.
// One measured episode held 176 frames across 9.95 seconds, an average near
// 17.7 Hz, but the instantaneous interval wandered well away from that and the
// next episode has no reason to average the same.
//
// Where the real timing comes from. It was recorded all along.
// cameras/<source>/index.jsonl holds one line per kept frame carrying
// canonical_episode_nanos, the frame's position on the episode's canonical
// CLOCK_BOOTTIME timeline, along with the segment file, byte offset and byte
// size of its payload. This package remuxes those same payload bytes into an
// MP4 whose sample table gives every frame the presentation time the index
// recorded for it. Nothing here computes, averages, or assumes a rate.
//
// It is a remux, not a transcode: the coded pictures are copied verbatim and
// only re-framed, so the output is bit-for-bit the same video.
//
// Container choice. MP4 with an explicit per-sample duration for every sample
// in the stts box. Matroska is the more usual home for variable frame rate and
// mkvmerge --timestamps the usual route to it, but mkvmerge is an extra
// dependency and QuickTime Player cannot open Matroska at all, whereas MP4
// represents variable frame rate exactly as precisely and plays unmodified in
// both VLC and QuickTime. The muxer below is pure Go, so the tool has no
// external dependency to be missing: there is no ffmpeg, mkvmerge or PyAV in
// the path from an episode to a playable file.
//
// The episode is read-only here. Convert writes into a separate destination
// directory. The elementary stream and index are the checksummed archival
// truth, and index.jsonl addresses frames by byte offset within the stream, so
// rewriting it in place would break the join between a frame and the model
// input recorded against it.
//
// ConvertSourceInPlace is the one sanctioned exception to that separation: the
// agent calls it while sealing an episode, before the manifest's file list is
// finalized, to add cameras/<source>/playable.mp4 beside the raw capture. The
// raw segments and index are still only read; the derived clip is a new file
// that the seal then checksums, lists and uploads like everything else, so a
// browser can play the episode straight from the bucket.
