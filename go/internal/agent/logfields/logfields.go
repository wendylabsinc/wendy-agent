// Package logfields defines the canonical snake_case keys used for structured
// zap log fields in the wendy-agent. Using these constants keeps attribute
// keys consistent across the agent so logs are queryable once exported as OTel
// records via services.TelemetryCore.
//
// Prefer these constants for the common, reused fields. Log errors with
// zap.Error(err) (key "error"). Keys are snake_case; add new constants here
// rather than repeating string literals at call sites.
