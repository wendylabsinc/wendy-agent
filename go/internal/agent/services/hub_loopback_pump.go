// loopbackFrameWriter is the seam between the pump and the v4l2loopback node.
//
// It exists so the part of this feature that can be reasoned about and tested
// on any platform (which frames are bindable, what the pump records, how drops
// are accounted) is separated from the part that can only be exercised on a
// Linux device with the module loaded (the ioctls themselves). Tests inject a
// fake; the Linux build injects the real V4L2 OUTPUT writer.
type loopbackFrameWriter interface {
	// WriteFrame queues one whole access unit on the node's OUTPUT queue,
	// stamping it with boottimeNanos, and returns the sequence the KERNEL
	// assigned to it.
	//
	// The two directions are deliberate and not symmetric. Returning the
	// kernel's sequence rather than accepting one from the caller is the whole
	// basis of the binding: v4l2loopback overwrites any sequence a writer
	// supplies with its own write_position, and hands the result back on the
	// same ioctl. The timestamp goes the other way, because the module copies a
	// nonzero writer timestamp through to the reader verbatim and flags it as
	// writer-supplied. See hub_loopback_binding.go for the full reasoning.
	//
	// boottimeNanos is the frame's canonical CLOCK_BOOTTIME receipt, the same
	// value the binding and FrameIdentity carry, so the in-band stamp and the
	// control plane can never disagree about a frame.
