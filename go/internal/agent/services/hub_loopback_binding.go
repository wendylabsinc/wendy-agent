// The two-plane camera path, and why the frame identity binding is shaped the
// way it is.
//
// An application that wants to use ordinary tooling (ffmpeg, GStreamer) cannot
// consume SensorService.Subscribe without a bespoke gRPC integration, and the
// camera entitlement's raw device node makes the app an INDEPENDENT second
// reader of the camera, so the frame a model scores is not provably the frame
// the episode recorded. The two-plane path fixes both: one producer, two
// planes.
//
//   - Data plane: a v4l2loopback node fed from the SAME producer hub that
//     episode capture and gRPC subscribers already consume. The app reads that
//     node with any standard tool, unmodified.
//   - Control plane: the existing SensorService stream carries identity only
//     (source id, sample id, canonical boottime, uncertainty). The pixels never
//     travel that way, so per-frame gRPC framing cost stays negligible.
//
// The binding between them is this file's subject.
//
// # Why sample_id cannot be written into v4l2_buffer.sequence
//
// The obvious design is to stamp our sample_id into v4l2_buffer.sequence on the
// buffer we queue, so a consumer reading the loopback reads our identifier back
// out directly. THAT DOES NOT WORK, and the reason is in the v4l2loopback
// module rather than in anything we control.
//
// In v4l2loopback's VIDIOC_QBUF handler for V4L2_BUF_TYPE_VIDEO_OUTPUT, the
// sequence field of the queued buffer is overwritten unconditionally:
//
//	bufd->buffer.sequence = dev->write_position;
//
// (and identically in the write() path). dev->write_position is the module's
// own monotonic count of frames written to that node. Whatever sequence value a
// writer supplies is discarded. There is no module option, format flag, or
// ioctl that disables this overwrite OF THE SEQUENCE. So a design that says
// "sequence IS the sample id" would be claiming a guarantee the kernel actively
// prevents us from keeping.
//
// # The timestamp, unlike the sequence, IS the writer's
//
// That limit is specific to the sequence field, and it would be wrong to read
// it as "the writer controls nothing per buffer". Verified against v4l2loopback
// v0.15.4, the version the Yocto recipe pins, the very same OUTPUT branch of
// vidioc_qbuf hands the writer's timestamp straight through:
//
//	if (!(bufd->buffer.flags & V4L2_BUF_FLAG_TIMESTAMP_COPY) &&
//	    (buf->timestamp.tv_sec == 0 && buf->timestamp.tv_usec == 0)) {
//	        v4l2l_get_timestamp(&bufd->buffer);
//	} else {
//	        bufd->buffer.timestamp = buf->timestamp;
//	        bufd->buffer.flags |= V4L2_BUF_FLAG_TIMESTAMP_COPY;
//	        bufd->buffer.flags &= ~V4L2_BUF_FLAG_TIMESTAMP_MONOTONIC;
//	}
//
// The module substitutes its own clock only for a writer that supplies a ZERO
// timestamp. A nonzero one is copied verbatim and latches
// V4L2_BUF_FLAG_TIMESTAMP_COPY, which says exactly "this value came from the
// writer". On the read side vidioc_dqbuf's CAPTURE branch does
// `*buf = dev->buffers[index].buffer;` and then unset_flags, which clears only
// V4L2_BUF_FLAG_QUEUED and V4L2_BUF_FLAG_DONE, so both the timestamp and the
// COPY flag reach the reading application intact.
//
// So identity does ride in-band after all, just not in the field the naive
// design wanted. The pump stamps each buffer with the frame's canonical
// CLOCK_BOOTTIME receipt truncated to whole microseconds by struct timeval,
// which is the same number FrameIdentity.boottime_nanos carries divided by
// 1000; the truncation is exact because 1e9 divides evenly by 1000. A consumer
// can therefore check every frame it dequeues against the identity it resolved,
// with no extra field on the wire and no side channel needed for the check.
//
// The sequence remains the PRIMARY join key and the timestamp is a secondary
// one. Two reasons: the sequence is what makes an application-side drop visible
// (see drop case 2 below), which a timestamp cannot do, and the sequence is
// exact where microseconds are truncated. Nothing below changes.
//
// # What is sound instead: observe the kernel's number, publish the mapping
//
// The same QBUF handler copies the buffer struct back out to userspace after
// stamping it, and does so BEFORE the write position is advanced:
//
//	bufd->buffer.sequence = dev->write_position;
//	set_queued(bufd->buffer.flags);
//	*buf = bufd->buffer;          // <- returned to the writer
//	buffer_written(dev, bufd);    // <- this is what does ++dev->write_position
//
// So the writer LEARNS, from the ioctl it just issued, the exact sequence the
// kernel assigned to the frame it just wrote. That value is authoritative, it
// requires no assumption that the counter started at zero (it does not reset
// per open, only at device creation), and it does not depend on arrival order
// or on counting frames ourselves.
//
// The binding is therefore inverted relative to the naive design: the pump does
// not choose the sequence, it observes the one the kernel chose, and records
// (loopback sequence -> sample identity) in the table below. The control plane
// publishes that mapping. An app reading the loopback takes the sequence off the
// buffer it dequeued and looks it up.
//
// # What a consumer sees when frames are dropped
//
// There are two independent drop points, and they are detected by two DIFFERENT
// signals. Conflating them is the main way a consumer of this API can fool
// itself, so both are spelled out here and both are represented in the record.
//
//  1. Hub -> pump. The hub drops frames for a subscriber that is not reading
//     fast enough (deviceHub.broadcast's non-blocking send, counted per
//     subscriber in subDrops). Those frames are never written to the loopback at
//     all. The loopback sequence therefore stays DENSE across such a drop: the
//     kernel counts only what we actually wrote, so a consumer watching only
//     v4l2_buffer.sequence sees no gap and would wrongly conclude nothing was
//     lost. What does change is sample_id, which jumps. This is why every
//     binding carries HubDropsBefore, and why the control plane reports the
//     sample_id: a gap here is visible ONLY on the control plane.
//
//  2. Pump -> app. The application reading the loopback node is not keeping up,
//     and the module's ring overruns. v4l2loopback handles this in
//     get_capture_buffer by fast-forwarding the reader rather than blocking:
//
//     if (dev->write_position > opener->read_position + dev->used_buffer_count)
//     opener->read_position = dev->write_position - 1;
//
//     The reader's next dequeued buffer therefore carries a sequence that has
//     JUMPED. Frames the pump genuinely wrote never reached this reader. This
//     gap IS visible on the data plane: consecutive dequeued buffers differ in
//     sequence by more than one, and the difference minus one is exactly the
//     number of frames that reader missed. sequenceGap below computes it.
//
// Stated as a rule for consumers: a jump in sample_id with dense sequence means
// the agent could not keep up feeding the node; a jump in sequence means the
// application could not keep up reading it. Both can happen at once, and they
// are additive, not alternatives.
//
// A third case is not a drop and must not be reported as one: if the pump fails
// to write a frame, it records no binding and the kernel never advances its
// counter, so the frame is simply absent from both planes rather than appearing
// as a lost one.

// loopbackBinding is one recorded correspondence between a frame the pump wrote
// to a v4l2loopback node and the harness identity of the sample it came from.
//
// LoopbackSequence is the value the KERNEL assigned and handed back on QBUF, not
// a value we chose (see the file comment). Everything else is copied from the
// hub frame, so a consumer that resolves a sequence gets exactly the identity
// the episode index and the model-input ledger recorded for the same sample.

//
// This predicate is where the honest scope of the feature is enforced, so the

//
// The binding is only meaningful if each frame the pump takes off the hub
// becomes exactly one frame on the node. Two things break that:
//
//   - A frame that is not a whole access unit. auAligned is set only by the
//     native V4L2 producer, which delivers one V4L2 buffer per encoded frame.
//     The GStreamer and IP camera producers read a byte stream from a pipe, so
//     their frames are arbitrary chunk-sized slices that can begin or end
//     mid-access-unit. Writing those to a node frame-for-frame produces buffers
//     that are not frames, and a sequence that counts chunks rather than
//     pictures. There is no binding to be had, so we refuse rather than publish
//     a sequence that means nothing.
//
//   - A decoder placed between the hub and the node. Feeding the raw-pixel
//     consumers (notably OpenCV's default V4L capture, which will not accept a
//     compressed fourcc) would mean decoding H.264 in the pump and writing raw
//     frames. A decoder does not preserve the correspondence: B-frame
//     reordering means the Nth frame in is not the Nth frame out, and a decoder
//     may drop or emit frames on its own. The Nth-write-is-the-Nth-sample
//     inference would then be silently wrong. So this path does not decode, and
//     consequently does not serve raw-pixel consumers at all. That is a real
//     limitation of the feature, not an omission to be patched later by adding a
//     decoder: adding one would destroy the guarantee the feature exists to
//     make.
