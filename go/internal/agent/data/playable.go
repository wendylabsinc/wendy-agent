// muxPlayableClips writes cameras/<source>/playable.mp4 for every camera
// source of a finished episode. It runs while the episode is being sealed,
// before sealFiles walks the directory, so the derived clip gets a size and
// SHA-256 entry in the manifest and is uploaded and verified exactly like the
// capture it derives from. The point is browser playback straight from the
// bucket: browsers cannot play the raw H.264 elementary stream, and the remux
// gives every frame the presentation time cameras/<source>/index.jsonl
// recorded for it.
//
// It never fails or blocks the seal. The remux is a copy, not a transcode, so
// its cost is one more pass over the camera bytes beside the checksum pass the
// seal already makes, and the clip it leaves is roughly the size of the raw
// stream it derives from; that size is counted against the episode by both
// the manifest total and the disk-usage walk enforceQuota performs. A source
// whose stream cannot become an honestly timed, seekable clip (B slices,
// slice headers the muxer cannot parse, no random-access frame, or an
// outright mux failure) seals without its playable.mp4, and the returned
// notes, published as the manifest's playable_notes, name why. A clip that
// was written but had to omit frames whose bytes were missing gets a note
// too, so the manifest never presents a partial clip as a complete one.
//
// The raw capture is never touched: index.jsonl keeps addressing frames by
// byte offset into the raw segments, so the correlation join between a frame
// and the model input recorded against it is unaffected.
