//
// Why a container needs this at all: the numbers in a spec are a snapshot of
// the host taken when the container was created. Several of the device majors
// an AI box depends on — Jetson's nvgpu and nvidia-uvm nodes, AMD's /dev/kfd —
// are allocated from the kernel's dynamic pool at module load, so they are
// stable for a boot rather than for the life of a container definition. A
// container definition outlives a boot: containerd persists it and recreates
// only the task. A spec can therefore name a number the running kernel has
// since moved, which from inside the container is indistinguishable from the
// hardware being absent — CUDA reports "no device", or the kernel denies
// permission, while the host looks perfectly healthy.
//
// Both failure shapes are covered, because both kinds of pin are recorded:
//   - a device entry plus its cgroup rule (the GPU nodes) — the container's own
//     node ends up pointing at nothing;
//   - a bind-mounted host node with only a cgroup rule (/dev/kfd, i2c, serial)
//     — the node is right but the rule blocks it.
