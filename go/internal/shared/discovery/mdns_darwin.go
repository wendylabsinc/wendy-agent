// pump for every other device on the network while a resolve runs up to its

// already emitted: unlike those picker-facing continuous browses, this
// backend keeps no de-dup set of its own. mDNSResponder re-fires Add on
// ordinary answer refresh even when nothing changed, and the stream engine
// (lanStream.handleSighting) is what already decides whether a re-resolve
// changed anything — so a device that moves address without ever going
// offline is still caught, which a permanent de-dup set here would prevent.
