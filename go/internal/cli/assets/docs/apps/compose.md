# Multi-Service Apps with Docker Compose

Wendy supports running multi-service applications defined in a standard `docker-compose.yml` (or `compose.yml`) file. This is the recommended approach when your app needs more than one container, for example an API service alongside a database, or a perception pipeline with several processing stages.

## How it works

When you run `wendy run` in a directory that contains a compose file, Wendy automatically detects it as a compose project. Each service is built, pushed to the device's embedded container registry, and started in dependency order. No `wendy.json` is required; each service carries its own configuration, and an optional companion `wendy.json` in the same directory is merged in when present (see [Readiness probes and postStart hooks](#readiness-probes-and-poststart-hooks)).

Supported compose file names (checked in order, first found wins):
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `docker-compose.yaml`
- `compose.yml`
- `compose.yaml`

A compose file takes precedence over a `Dockerfile` in the same directory. To force the single-container Docker path instead, pass `--build-type docker` or `--dockerfile <path>`.

## Quickstart

```
my-project/
  docker-compose.yml
  api/
    Dockerfile
    main.py
  worker/
    Dockerfile
    worker.py
```

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  api:
    build: ./api
    network_mode: host

  worker:
    build: ./worker
    network_mode: host
    depends_on:
      - api
```

```sh
wendy run
```

Wendy selects a device, builds each service image, pushes them to the device, and starts them concurrently with interleaved log output. Each service's lines are prefixed with a color-coded, column-aligned service name. Colors rotate through cyan, yellow, green, magenta, blue, and red. Log lines are never interleaved mid-line; each line is written atomically:

```
[api]     Listening on :8080
[worker]  Connected to api
[worker]  Processing item 1
```

Service builds run in parallel, while the device-intensive image preparation
phase is limited to two services at a time so a high `--max-concurrency` value
does not overload device storage. After a successful chunk-based preparation,
Wendy records the service's complete desired-state hash and exact layer IDs. A
later run with unchanged source and runtime configuration skips image building,
chunking, transfer, and preparation only after confirming that the service's
container and every recorded layer are still present on the device. Missing or
unverifiable content fails closed and performs a normal preparation. Set
`WENDY_PUSH_SKIP=0` to disable this optimization while diagnosing builds.

Press **Ctrl-C** to stop all services. Services are stopped in reverse dependency order; the CLI prints `Stopping <name>...` for each service and then a final `Stopped N service(s).` summary.

## Detached mode hint

When all services start in detached mode (`--detach`), the CLI prints a hint showing how to stream logs:

```
Run 'wendy device logs' to stream logs.
```

## Service fields

Wendy honours the following compose fields. Fields not listed here are ignored.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `build` | Build context: a path string or a `{ context, dockerfile, args }` mapping. `dockerfile` may name a `Dockerfile`, `Containerfile`, a dot/hyphen variant of either, or a Stagefile (`prod.stagefile.yaml`), and must resolve inside the build context. See [Build files](#build-files) for how the default is chosen when `dockerfile` is omitted. Services without `build` use a pre-built image via `image`. |
| `image` | Pre-built image to pull and run on the device (e.g. `redis:7-alpine`). Public image names are normalised to their fully-qualified form automatically. |
| `command` | Override the container's default command. Accepts a string (shell-split) or a YAML sequence. |
| `environment` | Environment variables to inject. Parsed from key-value maps or `KEY=VALUE` lists. Applied in order: image env → compose env → Wendy system vars → framework vars (e.g., ROS2) → OTEL vars. OCI last-wins semantics apply. |
| `ports` | Records `host:container` mappings on a `network` entitlement. This does not implement bridge DNAT or publish an isolated container to the host browser. |
| `network_mode: host` | Adds a `host` network entitlement. |
| `volumes` | Named volumes are created as `persist` entitlements. Host bind mounts (paths starting with `.` or `/`) are silently skipped. |
| `depends_on` | Dependency order: list or condition-map form. Services are created in dependency order; detached starts follow the same order, but the condition-map's own health-check conditions (e.g. `condition: service_healthy`) are not evaluated; ordering is purely topological. To gate a service's own postStart hook on its readiness instead, see [Readiness probes and postStart hooks](#readiness-probes-and-poststart-hooks). |
| `restart` | Restart policy: `no`, `on-failure`, `always`, `unless-stopped`. Overridden by CLI flags if specified. |
| `x-wendy` | Wendy-specific per-service extensions: `readiness` (a readiness probe) and `hooks` (postStart hooks). Same camelCase schema as `wendy.json`'s top-level `readiness`/`hooks` fields. See [Readiness probes and postStart hooks](#readiness-probes-and-poststart-hooks) below. |

The following fields are recognized but intentionally ignored, each with a warning at deploy time: `devices`, `privileged`, `cap_add`, `security_opt`, `ipc`, `pid`, `shm_size`, `healthcheck`, `profiles`, `secrets`, and `extra_hosts`. Hardware access goes through Wendy entitlements in a companion `wendy.json` instead. Anything else (such as `networks`, `deploy`, `entrypoint`, `env_file`, or long-form volume syntax) is ignored silently.

## Build files

A service's `dockerfile` may name a Stagefile as well as a Dockerfile. Stagefiles are compiled to a Dockerfile before the image build, so nothing else about the service changes:

```yaml
services:
  api:
    build:
      context: ./api
      dockerfile: prod.stagefile.yaml
```

When `dockerfile` is omitted, Wendy resolves the default from the build context, in order:

1. `build.stagefile.yaml` — the canonical Stagefile.
2. Otherwise the first `<name>.stagefile.yaml` in the context, alphabetically. A context that holds only variants has no conventional default, and falling through to `Dockerfile` would silently ignore the Stagefiles plainly sitting there. Name one explicitly with `dockerfile:` to pick a different variant.
3. Otherwise `Dockerfile`.

Two services may share one build context and point at different build files. Each Stagefile compiles to its own artifact (`Dockerfile.generated` for the canonical one, `Dockerfile.generated.<variant>` otherwise), so concurrent service builds in a shared context never overwrite each other's compiled Dockerfile. See [Stagefile naming](../clients/wendy-cli/commands/build.md#stagefile-naming) for the filename rules.

`docker compose build` itself knows nothing about Stagefiles, so `wendy build` compiles them first and passes a generated override file pointing the affected services at their compiled Dockerfile. Running plain `docker compose build` on the same project — without Wendy — will fail on a `dockerfile:` that names a Stagefile.

## Networking

Set `network_mode: host` for services that must share host ports, use multicast, pass CLI readiness probes, or be reached from the developer's browser.

Omitting `network_mode` while declaring `ports` currently creates a legacy mode-less network entitlement, which maps to host networking with a deprecation warning; the mappings do not create an isolated bridge or DNAT rules. To request isolated outbound networking, declare `{ "type": "network", "mode": "bridge" }` in a companion `wendy.json`, without relying on Compose `ports:` for inbound access. Bridge mode supplies a private namespace, DNS, and outbound NAT only. `network.ports` mappings on mesh entitlements are for mesh-peer traffic, not host/LAN browser ingress.

## Volumes

Named volumes declared in `volumes:` become persistent storage on the device and survive container restarts and re-deployments. Two services sharing a volume name share the same storage.

```yaml
services:
  producer:
    build: ./producer
    volumes:
      - shared-data:/data/out

  consumer:
    build: ./consumer
    volumes:
      - shared-data:/data/in

# Declare named volumes at the top level so the file stays valid for
# plain `docker compose` too. Wendy itself only reads the `services:`
# block; the service-level references above are what create the storage.
volumes:
  shared-data:
```

> Host bind mounts (e.g. `./local-path:/container/path`) are not supported on device; they are skipped.

## Readiness probes and postStart hooks

A compose service can declare its own readiness probe and postStart hooks under `x-wendy`, using the same camelCase schema as `wendy.json`'s `readiness`/`hooks` fields:

```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    x-wendy:
      readiness:
        tcpSocket:
          port: 3000
        timeoutSeconds: 30
      hooks:
        postStart:
          openURL: "http://${WENDY_HOSTNAME}:3000"
```

`readiness` here gates only `frontend`'s own `postStart` hook; it never delays any other service's startup (`depends_on` ordering is unaffected). `hooks.postStart.agent` runs directly on the device host and is triggered only by the declaring service's own container start.

A companion `wendy.json` in the same directory can also declare `services.<name>.readiness` / `services.<name>.hooks` for a service. When both are present, the companion wins wholesale per field: its `readiness` and `hooks` each replace the `x-wendy` value entirely rather than merging with it.

A companion `wendy.json`'s *top-level* `readiness`/`hooks` or `http` entitlement act instead as an app-level fallback: they fire once after every service in the project has started, rather than gating any single service. Inherited top-level HTTP remains in every service's container create configuration, but it is not executed once per service. A companion `services.<name>.entitlements` HTTP declaration is service-scoped; if both scopes declare HTTP, both actions run at their respective scopes. [Examples/WendyMC](../../Examples/WendyMC) uses a top-level `{ "type": "http", "port": 8080 }` entitlement with `readiness.timeoutSeconds: 180`, so the CLI preserves that timeout and opens the UI once after both services start. A top-level `hooks.postStart.agent` is the one exception: a compose app has no single app-level container start to trigger it, so it is ignored (with a warning); declare an agent-side hook under a service's `x-wendy.hooks` or the companion's `services.<name>.hooks` instead.

In attached mode, each service's readiness→postStart sequence runs asynchronously right after that service's start is acknowledged, so a slow or failing probe never delays starting the next service; Ctrl-C cancels any in-flight readiness wait and kills `cli` hook child processes. In detached mode none of this runs: no readiness wait, no `App reachable` line, and no host-side `postStart` action — only the agent-side `postStart.agent` hooks run, on the device. With `wendy run --watch`, each container's `openURL` and `cli` actions run once per session after its first successful readiness check; later saves do not repeat them, while a failed or canceled attempt may retry after a later deploy. `--watch --detach` skips these actions. A non-cancellation timeout in attached mode warns without failing the command: explicitly configured multi-service hooks still run, while `App reachable` and any synthesized HTTP browser open are suppressed. Cancellation suppresses all three. An explicit readiness TCP port remains the probe target; presentation prefers a hostname-templated `openURL`, then the HTTP entitlement port, then the readiness port. See [Watch mode](../clients/wendy-cli/commands/run.md#watch-mode) for details.

Hook commands may reference `${WENDY_HOSTNAME}` (the device host), `${WENDY_APP_ID}`, and `${WENDY_SERVICE_NAME}` (the declaring service's name; empty for the app-level fallback). Windows-style `%VAR%` forms are accepted too.

For a compose file with more than one service, `WENDY_APP_ID` is the project directory name and `WENDY_SERVICE_NAME` is the service name. A **single-service** compose project without a companion `wendy.json` uses `<project>-<service>` as `WENDY_APP_ID` (for example, `myproj-web`) and leaves `WENDY_SERVICE_NAME` empty. When a companion file is present, its `appId` is used and grouped naming applies even when there is only one service.

> Readiness probes and browser URLs dial the device host, not the container directly, so browser-reachable HTTP currently requires `network_mode: host`. Bridge mode provides outbound NAT only, and mesh port mappings serve mesh peers rather than the developer's browser.

## Flags

All `wendy run` flags work with compose projects:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--deploy` | Build and create all containers but do not start them. |
| `--detach` | Start all containers but do not stream logs. See [Readiness probes and postStart hooks](#readiness-probes-and-poststart-hooks). |
| `--restart-unless-stopped` | Set restart policy to `unless-stopped` for all services (overrides per-service setting). |
| `--restart-on-failure` | Set restart policy to `on-failure` for all services. |
| `--no-restart` | Disable restart for all services. |
| `--debug` | Enable debug logging during build and run. |
| `--yes` / `-y` | Accept all device-selection prompts automatically. |
| `--watch` | Redeploy on changes and stream app logs between deploys. Requires a Wendy agent target when attached; use `--watch --detach` for provider targets. |

## Limitations

- Headless Mac is not supported. `wendy run` rejects compose projects before any registry or Docker setup when the selected target is Headless Mac. Target a Linux/WendyOS device to use compose.
- Wendy-specific hardware access entitlements such as `gpu`, `display`, `camera`, `audio`, `bluetooth`, `usb`, `i2c`, `gpio`, `spi`, `input`, and `serial` are not inferred from compose fields.
- Host networking does not imply shared IPC or shared `/dev/shm`; ROS 2 shared-memory transport requires an app shape that can explicitly share namespaces.
- Linux containers on macOS require a target WendyOS device; local Docker Desktop compose is used as a fallback when no device is targeted.
- Compose `extends`, `profiles`, and `secrets` are not supported.
- `wendy fleet run` does not support compose projects yet; deploy to one device at a time.
- `wendy run --service` applies only to `wendy.json` `services` maps; the compose path always deploys every service.
- `wendy build` for a compose project shells out to `docker compose build`. The Apple Container builder is not supported for compose; use `--builder docker`.
