# Multi-Service Apps with `wendy.json`

When your project needs more than one container managed through a `wendy.json` file (rather than a `docker-compose.yml`), declare a `services` map in `wendy.json`. `wendy run` detects the map and automatically orchestrates a parallel multi-service build and deployment. `wendy build` detects the same map and builds the images locally without deploying — see [Building without deploying](#building-without-deploying).

## `wendy.json` structure

```json
{
  "appId": "com.example.myapp",
  "platform": "linux",
  "services": {
    "db": {
      "context": "db"
    },
    "api": {
      "context": "api",
      "dependsOn": ["db"],
      "entitlements": [
        { "type": "network", "mode": "host" }
      ]
    },
    "frontend": {
      "context": "frontend",
      "dependsOn": ["api"]
    }
  }
}
```

### `services` map

Each key is a service name. Each value is a `ServiceConfig` object:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `context` | string | **yes** | Build context directory, relative to `wendy.json`. Must be a relative path and must not contain `..` components. |
| `entitlements` | array | no | [Entitlements](../device/entitlements.md) to apply to this service's container. Same schema as the top-level `entitlements` field. |
| `dependsOn` | array of strings | no | Names of other services in this `services` map that must be created before this one. All referenced names must exist in the same map. |
| `env` | object | no | Environment variables for this service's container. Overrides the top-level [`env`](./wendy.json.md#env) per key, so a service can change one variable without dropping the rest. |
| `readiness` | object | no | Readiness probe for this service. Same schema as the top-level `readiness` field; see [Readiness and lifecycle hooks](#readiness-and-lifecycle-hooks). |
| `hooks` | object | no | Lifecycle hooks for this service. Same schema as the top-level `hooks` field. |
| `resources` | object | no | CPU/memory/PID ceilings for this service. Overrides the top-level [`resources`](./wendy.json.md#resources) per field. |
| `frameworks` | object | no | Framework configuration (e.g. ROS 2) for this service, replacing the top-level `frameworks`. |

### Validation rules

`wendy.json` validation rejects the following:
- A service with an empty or missing `context`.
- A `context` that is an absolute path.
- A `context` that contains `..` path components.
- A `dependsOn` entry that references a service name not present in the `services` map.
- A service `entitlements` entry with an unknown or missing type.
- A service `persist` entitlement missing `name` or `path`, or with a non-absolute or `..`-containing `path`.
- A service `network` entitlement with a `mode` other than `"host"` or `"none"`.
- A service `i2c` entitlement with a device not in `i2c-N` format.
- A service `serial` entitlement with a device not matching the USB-only `ttyACM0` / `ttyUSB0` (`tty*N`) pattern.
- A service `mcp` entitlement with a port outside the range 1–65535.
- More than one `mcp` entitlement within a single service's `entitlements` array.

`ValidateJSON` additionally warns on deprecated entitlement types and unknown entitlement keys within service-level `entitlements` arrays, using the same rules applied to the top-level `entitlements` field.

## Readiness and lifecycle hooks

Any service in the `services` map may declare its own `readiness` probe and `hooks.postStart`, using the same schema as the top-level `readiness`/`hooks` fields:

```json
{
  "appId": "com.example.stack",
  "services": {
    "db": { "context": "db" },
    "cache": { "context": "cache" },
    "api": { "context": "api", "dependsOn": ["db", "cache"] },
    "frontend": {
      "context": "frontend",
      "dependsOn": ["api"],
      "readiness": {
        "tcpSocket": { "port": 3000 },
        "timeoutSeconds": 30
      },
      "hooks": {
        "postStart": {
          "openURL": "http://${WENDY_HOSTNAME}:3000"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Only a service that declares `readiness`, `hooks`, or a service-level `http` entitlement runs the readiness→postStart sequence; `db`, `cache`, and `api` above are unaffected.

### Scoping

- `readiness` gates only the declaring service's own `postStart` hook — it never delays other services' startup order (`dependsOn` ordering is a separate mechanism).
- A service-level `http` entitlement waits, announces, and opens only for that service. A top-level `http` entitlement remains in every container's create configuration but runs as an app-level action once, after every service starts. If both scopes declare HTTP, both actions run at their respective scopes.
- An explicit `readiness.tcpSocket.port` remains the probe target even when the same scope declares HTTP. The displayed/opened URL prefers an explicit hostname-templated `openURL`, then the HTTP port, then the readiness port; probing `9000` while opening `8080` is supported.
- `hooks.postStart.agent` runs directly on the device host and is delivered only with the declaring service's own container start call; starting another service does not trigger it.
- Hook commands may reference `${WENDY_HOSTNAME}` (the device host), `${WENDY_APP_ID}`, and `${WENDY_SERVICE_NAME}` — the declaring service's name, empty for single-container apps and for the app-level fallback below. Windows-style `%VAR%` forms are accepted too.

### App-level fallback

A top-level `readiness`/`hooks` or `http` entitlement in `wendy.json` acts as an app-level fallback: it fires once after every service has started, rather than gating any single service. Both the fallback and a service's own lifecycle configuration fire if both are declared. Two exceptions:

- A top-level `hooks.postStart.agent` is ignored for multi-service apps — there is no single app-level container start to trigger it. `wendy run` warns about this when it loads `wendy.json`; declare it under `services.<name>.hooks` instead.
- The fallback is skipped when `wendy run --service` selects a subset of services, since "every service has started" can't be guaranteed on a partial run.

### Attached vs. detached

In attached mode, each service's readiness→postStart sequence fires asynchronously right after that service's start is acknowledged, so a slow or failing probe never delays starting the next service. Ctrl-C cancels any in-flight readiness wait and kills `cli` hook child processes. If the run ends on its own — every service's log stream closes — while a hook (per-service or the app-level fallback) is still waiting on readiness, that hook is suppressed rather than fired, so `wendy run` never opens a browser onto a stack that has already exited. In detached mode none of this runs: no readiness wait, no `App reachable` line, and no host-side `postStart` action. Only the agent-side `postStart.agent` hooks, carried on each start RPC, still run on the device. With `wendy run --watch`, each service's `openURL` and `cli` actions run once per session after its first successful readiness check; later saves do not repeat them, while a failed or canceled check may retry after a later deploy. `--watch --detach` skips these actions. A non-cancellation readiness timeout in attached mode warns but does not fail the command: explicitly configured multi-service `postStart` hooks still run, while `App reachable` and any HTTP-entitlement-synthesized browser open are suppressed. Cancellation suppresses the warning, announcement, and hook.

## How `wendy run` handles multi-service projects

When `appCfg.Services` is non-empty, `wendy run` routes to the multi-service pipeline:

1. **Parallel build** — all service images are built and pushed concurrently, with up to 4 simultaneous builds by default. Override with `--max-concurrency`. In interactive terminals a per-service spinner displays each service's status (`waiting` → `building…` → `built (Xs)` / `failed`). While a service builds, its row names the Dockerfile step currently running and, where that step's output exposes it, appends live progress after a `·` separator:

    ⠹ api         [4/9] RUN pip install -r requirements.txt · 61%  128.0MB/797.3MB  95.2MB/s

In non-interactive terminals plain log lines are printed instead, with a heartbeat for each running step every 15 seconds.
2. **Ordered container creation** — containers are created one at a time in topological dependency order. A service listed in another service's `dependsOn` is created first.
3. **Start and stream** — all containers are started and their combined stdout/stderr is multiplexed to the terminal. Each line is prefixed with `[serviceName]`.

Press **Ctrl-C** to stop all services. The CLI cancels all streams, issues a `StopContainer` for each service concurrently, and waits up to 30 seconds before exiting.

### Container naming

Each service container ID follows the `{appId}_{serviceName}` convention (`_`
is the separator because `/` is not permitted in containerd container IDs). For
example, with `appId: "com.example.myapp"` and service `"api"`, the containerd
container ID is `com.example.myapp_api`. The corresponding snapshot key uses
`@` as the separator (`wendy-com.example.myapp@api`) to remain unambiguous when
either component contains a hyphen. The cgroup path component uses `@` as the
separator: `system.slice:edge-agent:com.example.myapp@api` (the systemd service segment
reflects the `WENDY_SYSTEMD_SERVICE_NAME` env var, which defaults to `edge-agent`;
`@` is used because it cannot appear in either a valid appId or serviceName,
eliminating any collision risk from the hyphen separator).

> **Note:** Single-container apps (no `serviceName` in the top-level
> `wendy.json`) are unaffected — their container ID remains the bare `appId`.

## Building without deploying

`wendy build` detects the same `services` map and builds every service (or a `--service` closure) into the local image store, tagged `<appid>-<service>:latest`, without deploying: nothing is pushed to a registry and nothing is created or started on a device. Useful for CI and pre-flight checks — confirm every service builds before running `wendy run`:

```sh
wendy build
wendy build --service api
```

See [`wendy build`](../clients/wendy-cli/commands/build.md#multi-service-manifests) for the full flag reference (`--service`, `--max-concurrency`, `--builder`, `--gpu-arch`, `--debug`).

## Filtering with `--service`

To build and run only a specific service (and its transitive dependencies):

```sh
wendy run --service api
```

This resolves `api` and all services reachable through its `dependsOn` graph. Services outside this subset are not built or started. Passing an unknown service name returns an error immediately.

## Flags

All standard `wendy run` flags apply. The following are particularly relevant for multi-service projects:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--service <name>` | Build and run only the named service and its transitive `dependsOn` dependencies. |
| `--deploy` | Build and create all containers but do not start them. |
| `--detach` | Start all containers but do not stream logs. See [Attached vs. detached](#attached-vs-detached). |
| `--keep-going` | Deploy services that build successfully instead of aborting the whole group on the first build/push failure. |
| `--max-concurrency <n>` | Max service images to build+push at once. 0 = default limit of 4. |
| `--watch` | Redeploy changed services while continuing to show logs from the whole app. Use `--watch --detach` to skip logs and `openURL`/`cli` actions. |

## Example layout

```
my-project/
  wendy.json
  db/
    Dockerfile
  api/
    Dockerfile
  frontend/
    Dockerfile
```

```sh
wendy run            # builds and starts all three services
wendy run --service api   # builds db and api only (frontend excluded)
```

## Crash-looping services

When a service within a group crashes and the agent's restart policy is
automatically restarting it, that service's individual entry in
`wendy device apps list` shows a red `↻` **crash-looping** state (nested under
the group header). The top-level app entry stays `Running` as long as at least
one service is up; it flips to `Crash-looping` only when every service is down
and the restart policy is still restarting at least one of them.

`wendy device logs --app <appId>` surfaces crash output from all service
members of the group, so a crash-looping service's logs are reachable without
naming the individual service.

## Limitations

- Log output is multiplexed with a `[serviceName]` prefix on each line. Per-service log stream routing is not yet available.
- Containers are created via individual `CreateContainer` calls in dependency order. A grouped `CreateAppGroup` RPC for atomic creation is planned as a follow-up.
- Headless Mac is not supported. `wendy run` rejects multi-service `wendy.json` projects when the selected target is Headless Mac, before any build or registry operation. Target a Linux/WendyOS device for multi-service workloads.
