# Cloud Discover

`wendy cloud discover` lists devices enrolled in Wendy Cloud.

## Usage

```sh
wendy cloud discover [flags]
```

## Output

In an interactive terminal the command shows a **live TUI** that auto-refreshes every 10 seconds. Each row displays the device name, type, IP address, and running agent version. In non-interactive environments (or when `--json` is passed) a JSON array is written to stdout.

### TUI keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate the device list |
| `enter` | Copy selected device info as JSON to clipboard |
| `a` | Copy all devices as JSON to clipboard |
| `u` | Update the selected device's agent binary in place |
| `q` / `Ctrl+C` | Quit |

If no devices are found, a descriptive message is shown instead:

- Without `--all`: `No online devices found. Use --all to include offline devices.`
- With `--all`: `No enrolled devices found.`

## Asset limit

To prevent unbounded memory growth from a misbehaving backend, `cloud discover` caps results at **10 000 devices**. If the backend streams more than 10 000 assets, the command exits with an error:

```
cloud returned more than 10000 devices
```

## Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--all` | `false` | Include offline (not currently connected) devices. By default only online devices are shown. |
| `--broker-url` | `$WENDY_BROKER_URL` (or derived from cloud endpoint) | Tunnel broker `host:port` used for version fetching and in-place updates. |
| `--cloud-grpc` | `""` | Cloud gRPC endpoint. Overrides session selection. When multiple sessions are stored and no default is set, an interactive terminal shows a session picker; a non-interactive environment errors. |
