# `wendy cloud discover`

Lists enrolled compute devices visible to the authenticated Wendy Cloud organization.

## Usage

```sh
wendy cloud discover [flags]
```

## Description

`wendy cloud discover` queries the Wendy Cloud asset service for devices registered in your organization. By default **only online devices** (those with an active broker presence) are returned. Pass `--all` to include devices that are currently offline.

In an interactive terminal the command launches a **live TUI** that refreshes the device list every 10 seconds and fetches the running agent version for each device concurrently. In non-interactive environments (pipes, CI, or when `--json` is passed) a JSON array is written to stdout instead.

When no devices match the filter, a contextual message is shown:

- **Default (online only):** `No online devices found. Use --all to include offline devices.`
- **With `--all`:** `No enrolled devices found.`

## Interactive TUI

The TUI displays a table with the following columns for each device:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Name | Device name |
| Type | Hardware device type |
| Version | Running agent version (fetched live; `—` while loading) |

The device's IP address is not shown as a column — cloud devices are reached by
name/ID through the broker tunnel. The address is still included in the
clipboard/JSON output (see below).

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate the device list |
| `enter` | Copy the selected device's info as JSON to the clipboard |
| `a` | Copy all listed devices as JSON to the clipboard |
| `u` | Update the selected device's agent binary to the latest release |
| `q` / `Ctrl+C` | Quit |

### In-place device update (`u`)

Pressing `u` on a highlighted device downloads the latest agent release from GitHub, uploads it to the device via the broker tunnel, and waits for the agent to restart (up to 60 seconds). A status message is shown during the update and the version column refreshes automatically on completion.

## JSON output

When run non-interactively (output is piped) or with `--json`, a JSON array is written to stdout. Each element contains:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | integer | Stable numeric asset ID. Pass this value to [`wendy cloud tunnel --device <id>`](./tunnel.md) to target unnamed or ambiguously named devices. Omitted when zero. |
| `name` | string | Device name (may be empty for devices enrolled without a name). |
| `type` | string | Human-readable hardware device type. |
| `address` | string | IP address reported by the cloud. |
| `version` | string | Running agent version. Omitted when it could not be determined. |

Example:

```json
[
  {"id": 42, "name": "playful-reed", "type": "Raspberry Pi 5", "address": "192.168.1.10", "version": "0.10.4"},
  {"id": 43, "name": "", "type": "Raspberry Pi 5", "address": "192.168.1.11"}
]
```

The `id` field is the primary mechanism for addressing a device that was enrolled without a name — pass it to `wendy cloud tunnel --device <id>`.

## Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--all` | `false` | Include offline devices in the results. When omitted only devices with an active broker presence are shown. |
| `--broker-url` | `$WENDY_BROKER_URL` (or derived from cloud endpoint) | Tunnel broker `host:port`. When empty the CLI derives the address from the cloud gRPC endpoint. |
| `--cloud-grpc` | `""` | Cloud gRPC endpoint. Overrides session selection. When multiple sessions are stored and no default is set, an interactive terminal shows a session picker; a non-interactive environment errors. |

## Examples

Show only online devices (default):

```sh
wendy cloud discover
```

Show all enrolled devices, including offline ones:

```sh
wendy cloud discover --all
```

Point at a specific cloud gRPC endpoint:

```sh
wendy cloud discover --cloud-grpc grpc.cloud.wendy.dev:443
```

Output JSON (non-interactive / scripting):

```sh
wendy cloud discover --json
# or pipe to force non-interactive mode:
wendy cloud discover | cat
```

## How it works

1. Reads the stored mTLS auth configuration (`~/.wendy/config.json`).
2. Constructs a `ListAssetsRequest` scoped to the authenticated organization with `IsComputeDevice = true`.
3. Unless `--all` is passed, sets `OnlineOnly = true` on the request so the server only streams back assets with an active broker presence.
4. Receives assets over a **server-streaming gRPC** call (`AssetService.ListAssets`) and collects them until the stream closes.
5. In TUI mode, concurrently fetches the agent version for each device through the broker tunnel (up to 5 parallel connections) and refreshes the full list every 10 seconds.
