# `wendy device enroll`

Enrolls the connected device with Wendy Cloud (or a local [pki-core](../../../../pki/)) and provisions it with mTLS certificates.

> **Note:** `wendy device enroll` is an advanced command and is not listed in
> `wendy device --help`. It remains fully functional. For most setups, use
> [`wendy device setup`](./setup.md) instead.

## Usage

```sh
wendy device enroll [--name <name>] [--cloud-grpc <endpoint>] [flags]
```

## Description

`wendy device enroll` creates an enrollment token using your stored auth session, then calls `StartProvisioning` on the connected agent so it fetches its certificate. Run [`wendy cloud login`](../cloud/login.md) first.

The enrolled device is registered in Wendy Cloud under a human-readable **name**. The name is fixed at enrollment time and cannot be changed afterward, so the command resolves it as follows:

1. **`--name <name>`** — always wins when provided.
2. **Hostname default** — when `--name` is omitted and the device is reachable by hostname (e.g. `playful-reed.local`), the name defaults to that hostname with any `.local` suffix stripped (so `playful-reed.local` → `playful-reed`).
3. **Interactive prompt** — in a terminal, when no `--name` is given the command prompts for a name. When a hostname default is available it is shown in brackets and used if you press Enter without typing anything:

   ```
   Device name [playful-reed]:
   ```
4. **Bare IP / no hostname** — when the device is addressed by a bare IP (no resolvable hostname) and `--name` is omitted, there is no default. In a non-interactive environment this fails with:

   ```
   device name is required; pass --name when not running interactively
   ```

   In an interactive terminal it prompts for a name with no default and errors if you leave it blank.

> **Naming an unnamed device:** A device enrolled without a usable name shows up with an empty name in [`wendy cloud discover`](../cloud/discover.md). You can still address it by its numeric asset ID — see [`wendy cloud tunnel --device <id>`](../cloud/tunnel.md).

## Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--name` | hostname (`.local` stripped) | Human-readable device name. Defaults to the device hostname when omitted; required when the device is reachable only by a bare IP address in a non-interactive environment. |
| `--cloud-grpc` | `""` | Cloud / pki-core gRPC endpoint to use. Overrides session selection; when omitted, the persisted default (set with `wendy auth use`) is used if available, otherwise an interactive picker appears. |

## Examples

Enroll, defaulting the name to the device hostname:

```sh
wendy device enroll --device playful-reed.local
```

Enroll with an explicit name:

```sh
wendy device enroll --device 192.168.1.11 --name lab-pi-01
```
