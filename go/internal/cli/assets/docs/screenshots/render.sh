#
# render.sh — regenerate all Wendy CLI screenshots + animated clips, in both
# the light and dark docs themes, with one command.
#
# It drives the shipping `wendy` binary inside VHS's headless terminal. Because
# the captures come from a scripted REAL session, a WendyOS device must be
# ATTACHED (USB-C, or reachable on the same network) when you run this. This is
# a developer-machine step, NOT CI (see the design's Scope & non-goals).
#
# Usage:
#   ./render.sh                    # render every flow in tapes/, both themes
#   ./render.sh wifi-connect       # render only the named flow(s)
#   ./render.sh discover wifi-connect
#
# Output, for a flow <f> (steps <s>, themes <t> in {light,dark}):
#   ../images/docs/cli/<f>/<s>-<t>.png     one still per documented step
#   ../images/docs/cli/<f>/<f>-<t>.webp    animated clip of the whole flow
#
# That naming contract is the stable interface the <CliShot>/<CliClip> docs
# components depend on — keep it in sync with components/docs/cli-shot.tsx.
