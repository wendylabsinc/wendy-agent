# IPv4 DHCP

WendyOS assigns an IPv4 address to `usb0` through DHCP. There are two modes depending on how the host is set up.

## Modes

### Mode 1 — DHCP Client (Default)

In the default build configuration (`WENDYOS_USB_NET_MODE=dhcp`), WendyOS acts as a DHCP client on `usb0`. The host is expected to run a DHCP server on its NCM adapter. The most common way to do this on Linux is to activate a NetworkManager "shared" connection on the host-side interface, which starts a dnsmasq instance automatically and assigns `10.42.0.1/24` to the host.

The NetworkManager connection profile on the device (`/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/usb-gadget.nmconnection`) sets:
```ini
[ipv4]
method=@USB_NET_MODE@     # replaced at build time with "dhcp"
route-metric=700          # high metric, usb0 is the fallback route
```

The high route metric (`700`) means that Ethernet (`100`) and WiFi (`300`) are always preferred as the default route when available. `usb0` only becomes the default route if no other interface is up.

DHCP timeout is set to 300 seconds (`ipv4.dhcp-timeout=300`) to handle hosts that activate sharing after the device has already booted.

### Mode 2 — On-Device DHCP Server (Optional)

An alternative configuration ships an on-device dnsmasq instance that serves DHCP directly on `usb0`. This is provided by the `gadget-network-config` Yocto recipe.

Configuration file: `/etc/dnsmasq.d/usb-gadget-dnsmasq.conf`

```
interface=usb0
bind-interfaces

dhcp-range=10.42.0.2,10.42.0.5,12h

dhcp-option=3,10.42.0.1    # gateway = device itself
dhcp-option=6,8.8.8.8      # DNS

quiet-dhcp
quiet-dhcp6
quiet-ra
```

The systemd service `gadget-dnsmasq.service` starts after `gadget-setup.service` and runs dnsmasq with this config. It is type `simple` and restarts on failure.

In this mode the host receives an address from `10.42.0.2`–`10.42.0.5` and the device is the gateway at `10.42.0.1`. This requires the device to be configured with a static `10.42.0.1/24` address on `usb0`, which is done by setting `WENDYOS_USB_NET_MODE=shared` at build time.

## NetworkManager Configuration Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/usb-gadget.nmconnection` | Per-interface connection profile for `usb0` |
| `/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/10-usb-gadget.conf` | Ensures `usb0` is managed; sets `ipv6.method=link-local` |
| `/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/00-manage-usb0.conf` | Explicitly clears `unmanaged-devices` so NM manages all interfaces |
| `/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/99-interface-metrics.conf` | Sets route metrics: ethernet=100, wifi=300, usb=700 |

## Host-Side Setup

### Easiest — let `wendy discover` set it up (Linux)

On a Linux host, `wendy discover` auto-detects a USB-C-tethered Wendy device
whose host link isn't configured and offers to set it up for you. Accept the
prompt and enter your sudo password; the CLI brings the gadget interface up via
a NetworkManager "shared" profile (the host serves DHCP `10.42.0.1/24`, matching
the device's default DHCP-client mode) and installs a udev rule so ModemManager
stops grabbing the gadget's serial console.

To undo it later, remove the profile and rule manually:

```sh
sudo nmcli connection delete wendy-usb
sudo rm -f /etc/udev/rules.d/99-wendy-usb.rules
```

The manual steps below are equivalent and remain available.

### Mode 1 host setup — NetworkManager shared

Run on the host once the NCM interface (`enxXXXXXXXXXXXX`) appears:

```sh
nmcli connection add type ethernet ifname <enxXXX> ipv4.method shared
```

This activates a built-in dnsmasq instance, assigns `10.42.0.1/24` to the host, and enables NAT so the device can reach the internet through the host.

### Alternative — link-local addressing

The `setup-host-usb-link-local.sh` script in the `wendyos` repository configures the host for link-local addressing instead. This is useful when internet sharing is not needed. It supports both NetworkManager and systemd-networkd:

**NetworkManager** — installs `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/wendyos-usb.nmconnection`:
```ini
[connection]
type=ethernet
autoconnect-priority=100
match.driver=cdc_ncm;cdc_ether

[ipv4]
method=link-local
```

**systemd-networkd** — installs `/etc/systemd/network/80-wendyos-usb.network`:
```ini
[Match]
Driver=cdc_ncm cdc_ether

[Network]
LinkLocalAddressing=ipv4
```

## Verifying DHCP

```bash
# On the device — check address assigned to usb0
ip addr show usb0

# On the device — check NetworkManager state
nmcli connection show usb-gadget | grep -E "ipv4|IP4"

# On the device — watch DHCP exchange in journal
journalctl -u NetworkManager | grep -i "usb0\|dhcp"

# On the host — capture DHCP packets
sudo tcpdump -i enxXXXXXXXXXXXX port 67 or port 68 -vn
```

A successful DHCP exchange looks like:
```
DISCOVER → (device to host, broadcast)
         ← OFFER    (host to device)
REQUEST  → (device to host)
         ← ACK      (host to device)
```
