// chunkPushResumeAttempts bounds how many times pushLayersResumingTunnelDrops
// will attempt the chunk push before giving up. Each retry costs a fresh
// QueryChunks capability probe (plus whatever per-layer QueryChunks round
// trips a genuinely mid-layer drop leaves outstanding), so a small cap keeps
// a tunnel that's actually gone for good from hanging the deploy forever,
// while still covering the common case of a single drop and resume.

// retryableTunnelError reports whether err looks like a transport-level
// tunnel drop that reconnect-and-resume can recover from, as opposed to a
// failure the retry loop must leave alone:
//   - Unimplemented means the agent has no chunk-diff support at all; it must
//     bubble straight up so deployByChunkDiff's caller falls back to the
//     registry-push ladder instead of retrying a push that can never
//     succeed. (Same check as isUnimplementedRPCError, reused here so the two
//     stay in lockstep.)
//   - context cancellation (Canceled or DeadlineExceeded) is the user or a
//     deadline asking to stop, never a transport problem — retrying would
//     fight the cancellation instead of honoring it.
//   - imageBuildFailedError means the image never left the build stage; it
//     has nothing to do with the tunnel and reconnecting cannot help.
//
// Retryable: a gRPC Unavailable status, bare or wrapped (the transport
// reporting the tunnel is down), and an EOF-shaped stream death — io.EOF or
// io.ErrUnexpectedEOF, bare or wrapped — the shape a broken HTTP/2 stream
// surfaces as when the drop outruns the tunnel's own status framing.

// pushLayersResumingTunnelDrops runs pushLayersWithProgress and, when the
// connection is reconnectable (conn.Reconnect != nil — set only for cloud
// tunnels, see grpcclient.AgentConnection.Reconnect) and the failure looks
// like a tunnel drop (retryableTunnelError), reconnects and retries the push
// instead of failing the whole deploy over a mid-transfer disconnect.
//
// The retry's own QueryChunks calls see whatever the device already staged
// before the drop, so only the still-unsent bytes move again. And because
// pushLayersWithProgress builds a fresh chunkPushProgress aggregator on every
// call, the retry's own summary reports "device already has N/M chunks" —
// making the resume visible instead of silently re-diffing from zero
// (WDY-2431 tie-in).
//
// Scope is deliberately push-phase only: nothing here re-runs once
// RunContainer's Started response has been seen, so a drop after Started
// never re-triggers a redeploy. The unpack phase downstream has its own
// idle-safe keepalive (WDY-2433), so tunnel starvation there is already
// handled by a different mechanism.
//
// Returns the *grpcclient.AgentConnection that performed the returned
// result — conn itself if the first attempt succeeded (or nothing was
// retryable), or the last reconnected connection otherwise. The caller must
// close the returned connection iff it differs from conn; connections
// reconnected away from mid-loop (neither the original conn nor the one
// finally returned) are closed here.
//
// prepareFor, when non-nil, builds the device-side image-preparation func for
// a given client. It is a factory rather than a bare imagePrepareFunc so each
// retry's PrepareImage call rides the CURRENT (possibly reconnected)
// connection instead of the one that just dropped.
