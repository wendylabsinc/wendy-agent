// The mTLS dial path probes every CLI certificate against a device until one
// is accepted (see connectResolvedAgent). The probe order is the order the
// certs happen to load in, so an operator holding certificates for several
// organisations pays a full, doomed TLS handshake plus a GetAgentVersion probe
// for every org that isn't the device's — on every single command. Measured
// against a device on the second of two orgs, that wasted attempt was roughly
// half of a ~250ms connect, and TLS session resumption cannot recover it: a
// rejected first attempt is a fresh handshake by definition.
//
// Remembering which organisation last worked for a host and probing that one
// first removes the waste. The memo is a pure optimisation with no security
// weight: it only reorders candidates, never adds one, and a stale or wrong
// entry costs exactly what today's behaviour costs, because the remaining
// certs are still probed in their original order behind it.

// that last completed a probe against it.

//     (wipeable) and keys on the raw host, so "orin" and "orin.local" are

//     successful mTLS connect. It lives in the config directory, so it survives
//     a cache wipe, and its key is normalised ("orin.local" → "orin"), so a
//     dial by either spelling benefits from a connect made via the other.
