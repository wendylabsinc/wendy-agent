// UnknownSubcommandError returns a non-nil error when args name a subcommand
// that does not exist under a group command, and nil in every other case.
//
// Cobra does not do this for us. Its legacyArgs check rejects an unknown
// subcommand only for the root command, because it tests !cmd.HasParent()
// before erroring. Any nested group accepts the stray token as a positional
// argument instead. The group has no action of its own, so Command.execute
// takes its !c.Runnable() branch and returns flag.ErrHelp, which ExecuteC
// renders as that group's help page and a zero exit code. The result is that
// `wendy banana` fails loudly while `wendy device banana` prints the ordinary
// `wendy device` help and reports success, which is indistinguishable from
// having run `wendy device` on purpose.
//
// This runs ahead of cobra rather than through Command.Args because execute
// honours the help flag before it validates arguments: `wendy device banana
// --help` never reaches a validator, and that is the spelling people actually
// type when they are exploring an unfamiliar command.
