// Command episode-playable turns a downloaded episode's camera capture into
// playable MP4 files, one per camera source, with per-frame presentation
// timestamps read from the episode's own cameras/<source>/index.jsonl.
//
// It exists because episode camera capture keeps a bare H.264 Annex-B
// elementary stream, which carries no container and therefore no timing, so
// players invent a frame rate and the clip runs at the wrong speed. Supplying
// a fixed rate instead is wrong by construction: the capture rate varies with
// device load. See the episodeexport package for the full reasoning.
//
// The episode directory is only read. Output goes to a separate directory,
// because the elementary stream and its index are checksummed archival truth
// and index.jsonl addresses frames by byte offset within the stream.
//
// This is the natural body of a future "wendy data export" verb; it is a
// standalone command for now so it can ship without touching the CLI's command
// surface.
